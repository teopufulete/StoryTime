        <h2>Story 5</h2>

        <p>[WP] You receive a mysterious letter in your mailbox. It appears a group of fairies want to establish a "fairy garden" community in one of your flowerbeds. They don't want any trouble, they just wanted to let you know.. They're here.</p>       
        <p>I put the letter down next to the porcelain teacup. I really did not expect anything of sorts to interrupt my morning ritual. Reading while having tea in my garden is the favorite part of my day. At least since… Lilith passed away. She was the sun my to skies, the water to my flowers, the person I cherish the most. It's been two years since, and I can still hear her giggles at times when the wind is ruffling the cherry trees. She loved playing in the sun, running barefoot on the grass, climbing trees, whispering to flowers and then putting her tiny ear up to their opening as if to listen to their replies. “Mommy, mommy, Ms. Dhalia, said I’m pretty too!” she would excitedly announce. </p>
        <p>She always helped me water and take care of the flowers. Once in a while, when one of them died, she would come to me running with tears in her eyes, holding the brittle remains of what used to be one of her friends. She would insist we bury it properly, that’s how pure she was. I used to teach her about the ephemerality of things after every little burial. I had never expected life to teach me this same lesson. How brutal. The universe had taken away all I had adored. My sweet, sweet little girl. I felt a tear rolling down my cheek. </p>
        <p>The garden's laughter has ceased to with her. Her father had passed a little while after I got pregnant. Lilith was the best gift he could’ve given me. Oh, how I wish he stuck around for a while longer to meet her. But life never stops to give you what you want. In the end, in the midst of all the chaos, all you have left is yourself. I learned that the hard way.</p>       
        <p>The last thing I had left to help me cope with this unbearable loneliness, was my garden. I decided to keep tending it despite the amount of work it required, because of how much my little Lily loved it. It reminded me of her.</p>       
        <p>It started raining. The garden was always a shade brighter in the rain. It was as if the gift of the skies wasn't water, but liquid fairy dust, washing our world to show what was there all along, nature in her in humble brilliance. The buttercups became gold, the grass the shade of every dreamers meadow, roots quenched, soil renewed.</p>       
        <p>In the comfort of my gazebo, I wiped my tears away, picked up a pen and started writing.</p>     
        <p style="text-align:center">"My sweet dear fairies,<br> I’m grateful you picked my daisiesas your settlement.” <br> I hope it makes for a good home!</p>  
        <p>I stopped to notice the patter of rain was replaced with bursts of birdsongs, as if their hearts rejoiced the occasion of the quick shower. I picked up the pen again. Another tear was dripping down.</p>       
        <p style="text-align:center"></pstyle>“I’d promised my little girl magic <br> and it’s great to know I haven’t lied.”</p>
