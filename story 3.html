        <h2>Story 3</h2>

        <p>[WP] It's 3 AM. An official phone alert wakes you up. It says "DO NOT LOOK AT THE MOON". You have hundreds of notifications. Hundreds of random numbers are sending "It's a beautiful night tonight. Look outside."</p>
        <p>I had barely drifted off to sleep when I find myself woken up by a phone constantly vibrating. I gaze over to my boyfriend. He was still awake, scrolling through his phone.</p>
        <p>“Uhh, who’s that?” I say groggily.</p>
        <p>“Oh, it’s just my other girlfriend.” he replied with a dumb grin on his face.</p>
        <p>“Not now babe, I just wanna sleep.” I love this man but I cannot understand how he functions with so little sleep. I roll my eyes to his satisfaction and reach for the bedside table to check the time. I pick up my phone: 2:44 and 177 notifications. What the fuck? All were going on about how beautiful tonight’s moon is. I don’t even know that many people, this must be some kind of joke.</p>
        <p>“Did you write a program to spam me with texts?” I say as I delete all notifications when I notice an emergency alert. “DO NOT LOOK AT THE MOON” it read.</p>
        <p>“Huh? Even I’M above the standards of that sort of prank. C’mon, you have a big day tomorrow, you better get some rest.” he put my phone away and tucked me in. “I’ll be right back.”</p>
        <p>He was right, I had a job interview tomorrow. Still a bit disturbed by all those texts I decided it was not the right time to worry about them. Ethan left the bathroom door open as he usually does when he pees at night. An almost blinding light was coming out of it. “Huh, I could’ve sworn he didn’t turn the lights on.”</p>
        <p>“Baby…?” he says with an uneasy voice. “Close your eyes!! Don’t look at the light.” Then he goes silent.</p>
        <p>I rush into the bathroom covering my eyes.</p>
        <p>“Honey, are you okay?” I was panting. I peek through my fingers and I see him standing still. His eyes were widening and their color was changing. The deep and warm brown irises I’d get lost into for hours and hours every day were no longer there. Terror was settling in. I took a few steps back still covering my eyes when I hear a cracking noise. I peaked again. Oh, how I wish I hadn’t. His joints were bending at every wrong angle and his head had twisted at 180 degrees. I burst into tears. The love of my life was right beside me, yet I had never felt so helpless and terrified.</p>
        <p>He started squirming towards me. I didn’t run. Not knowing what to do, I dropped to the floor shaking and reached towards him. “Hold my hand. It’s g...going to be o...okay” I managed to mutter through my cries. What I once knew as his beautiful hand squeezed mine. It was ice cold. That’s when he finally spoke, in a gentle, all familiar tone.</p>
        <p>“It’s a beautiful night outside, my love. Look outside.”</p>
