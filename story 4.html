        <h2>Story 4: Three wishes</h2>

        <p>[WP] While watching Alladin with your friends, you jokingly rub a desk lamp and say “I wish genies were real.” To everyone’s surprise, a genie shoots out of the bulb and says “You have two wishes left.”</p>
        <p>Me and Aria both start screaming. “No fucking way!!”</p>
        <p>“I love when people have this reaction.” the genie says. “It’s a bit of shame you mortals don’t clean your lamps that frequently,  I’ve been trapped in there for so long.” he yawns.</p>
        <p>He looked nothing like your stereotypical genie. With characteristic human features he could pass as your neighbourhood librarian from a distance. Tall, thin, modestly dressed, except for the pair of square golden glasses that seemed too heavy for his frail physique. The only odd thing about his appearance was this translucent quality he seemed to have.</p>
        <p>“Can I make a wish?” Aria pushed me out of the way with a glow in her eyes.</p>
        <p>“I’m sorry but you weren’t the one rub the lamp, were you sweetheart? I’m only here to serve him, come forward young man.” the genie said pointing at me. I quickly obliged, still mesmerised by this opportunity I never even dreamt of having. “So the rules are simple.” he continues, pushing the golden frame up his nose. “Meta-wishes are strictly not allowed, so no wishing for more wishes. The second one may be less fun for you indecisive mortals, but you have to make your wishes in the span of 7 days. Once I leave there’s no coming back.”</p>
        <p>“That’s simple, Mason. Just wish to be the richest person in the world and you’ll have your future set! That’s what I’d do.” Aria encouraged me.</p>
        <p>“I… I don’t think that’s the right thing to do. For once, I’m not going to be selfish and let this opportunity to change the world slide.” Genie, I have decided. “I want every single person in the world to get along and leave peacefully.”</p>
        <p>“Oh? As you wish.” the genie said curiously. “Here we go again.” I thought I could hear him mutter as he snapped his fingers and we got transported to my utopia. </p>
        <p>First thing I noticed was how empty my house was. Everything around me was white: the walls, the few pieces of furniture and appliances and even our clothes.</p>
        <p>"Where... Where’s all my stuff?” I say pointing at the empty space where my tv used to be.</p>
        <p>“In this world you don’t need it anymore.” genie yawned. “Soon enough you’ll discover things aren’t quite as you remember. Shall we take a walk?”</p>
        <p>Outside everything was quiet. No screaming kids, very few cars, but the most surprising thing by far, was how everything was painted white and all houses looked exactly the same. “How the fuck do people know which their house is theirs?” I wondered to myself. Even the genie’s glasses were white in this world.</p>
        <p>“Why is everything white? It’s really unsettling.” Aria asked as if she could read my thoughts.</p>
        <p>“There are many things you have yet to learn about this place. Your friend here has wished for everyone to get along, so polarised opinions no longer exist. Knowing you humans, eradicating such a thing would be impossible unless you all lived very similar lives. You’ll find that everything in this world looks exactly the same no matter the country you are in, extending from cities, suburbias to villages. All of them have the exact same infrastructure, layout, shops and, I’m sure you’ve noticed, color! In order to eliminate inequality all people are allowed to have the same number of belongings per household. Because of this most of them have chosen to get rid of their tv, since nothing really happens, there’s no need for them anymore. news channels have gone out of business.”</p>
        <p>“Wait... what do you mean nothing happens?” I interrupted.</p>
        <p>“Well, since in this world disagreements don’t exist, news channels have gone out of business since there’s nothing to report. Even books or movies cannot be produced anymore, because for a good story line to exist something needs to happen, an antagonist needs a contradictory purpose than that of the hero. The people in this world cannot wrap their heads around such concepts. You will find that all cultures, ideologies, religion and even the concept of opinions have been eradicated as well.”</p>
        <p>“How… how dare you!? I did not ask for this.” I was fuming.</p>
        <p>“You know how many mortals have wished for such a world before you? To be perfectly honest, I’ve lost count. This is the only way. People will always fight each other, it’s in your blood. That is, unless nothing to disagree on exists.”</p>
        <p>I was astonished. I almost didn’t notice when Aria disappeared from our side. I looked back. There she was, a few steps back crouching and rocking back and forth.</p>
        <p>I ran up to her. “Are you okay?”</p>
        <p>“I just wanna go back home... This world is nothing like it.” she screamed with tears in her eyes. </p>        
        <p>A lady dressed in white with a baby in her arms saw us from her front yard and quickly approached Aria.</p>        
        <p>“I apologize for the intrusion.” she said in a sweet, high pitched voice. “Don’t you cry little girl, here!” she handed Aria an embroidered handkerchief. “Why don’t you and your friend come in for a snack? I’ve got fresh cookies in the oven!” it’s like she was irradiating kindness.</p>        
        <p>“Go away! Leave me alone!” Abby violently threw the handkerchief.</p>        
        <p>“Oh, I would not do that if I were you.” the genie seemed worried.</p>        
        <p>The lady ran away with a gasp as if it was her first time experiencing something like this. Not even a minute had passed, as I was trying to convince Aria to move from her spot on the pavement, a police car stopped next to us. Two officers got out.</p>        
        <p>“You there! Do not move!” they were pointing at Aria. “GPD!(Global Police Department) You are under arrest!”</p>        
        <p>“But she hasn’t done anything wrong, officer!” I exclaimed, but it was already too late. In absolute silence, they dragged Aria into their car, completely ignoring her struggling hystericalities.</p>        
        <p>I desperately looked at genie. “Don’t just stand there, do something!”</p>        
        <p>“Are you sure you want to use your last wish on your friend? You’ll get to see her again once she learns how to behave.”</p>        
        <p>“What’s that supposed to mean?!”</p>        
        <p>“As I said before, no conflict exists in this world and the Global Government is here to ensure it stays this way. All buildings and street corners are under surveillance 24/7. Whoever breaks the rules, although it rarely happens, needs to go under the official Virtue Reinforcement Programme. The details are never disclosed to the public, but it’s known they are always ready to use all means necessary in order to keep peace. No matter how drastic.” the genie yawned again.</p>        
        <p>I was speechless. Dumbfounded. The utopia I thought I had created was nothing like one.</p>        
        <p>A few days passed since the incident. It was probably around five or six, although I had lost count. I had never been so bored in my life. Genie was right, nothing was happening in this damn world.</p>        
        <p>“Why are there always so few people around?” I asked genie one afternoon while sitting on the porch.</p>        
        <p>“That’s a simple question. You sure must be a bit dense for not working this out already. You see, for humanity, it’s never enough to be economically satisfied, showered in all earthly blessing, and drowned in happiness. Even in a utopian society, you humans would go out of your way to break, destroy, set stuff on fire only to see something else happen. It’s just the human condition. Functioning in a boring, predictable society is against all common sense and rationality. When people realise there’s nothing they can do to stop it, they just kill themselves. As a result, the population has dropped to around a half from what you are used to. It’s that simple. The ones who remained are insane if you ask me.” the genie pushed his heavy spectacles up his nose.</p>        
        <p>“Of course.” that’s when it hit me. “Genie was right, I had only been here for about a week, and I was already going crazy due to… all of this... dullness.”</p>        
        <p>“I have made up my mind. I know what my final wish is going to be.” I replied with a smug grin on my face.</p>        
        <p>“Oh?” the genie seemed to be caught off guard.</p>        
        <p>“I wish for chaos.”</p>
